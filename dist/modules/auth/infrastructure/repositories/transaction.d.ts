/**
 * Auth repository — pure SQL access for the auth module.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - Every public function accepts an optional PoolClient so callers can
 *     compose multiple writes inside a single withTransaction block.
 *   - Functions never throw on "not found"; they return null/0/false so the
 *     service layer is the single owner of business-rule errors.
 *   - Sensitive bearer credentials (refresh tokens, email-flow tokens) are
 *     stored only as SHA-256 hashes; the plaintext is never persisted.
